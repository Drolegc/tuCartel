# tuCartel
A website about signboards

tuCartel its a website that connect customers with 'carteleros' (who makes sign boards)

The customers can upload an image (the facade of the sign board) and specify with and height,material of the structure and the material/s of the facade.

The system takes that request and give to the customer, a list of 'carteleros'. 
The system searches within all the 'carteleros' signed up to find those who have the materials needed. And then, it adds up to the list with the calculated price.

The customer can choose wich 'cartelero' would make the sign board

From the other side 

'Carteleros' needs to had an inventory of materials, each one with a precie per meter
'Carteleros' can accept or not the request for many clients

If the 'cartelero' accept any request, hee needs to be in touch with the costumer, and viceversa.

Once the 'cartelero' finished the work, he takes a confirmation photo. Then upload it to the website so the costumer can rate his job. Once the costumer did that, in the 'cartelero's history, he work will appear done, with a comment and rated 

This is a quick "How it works", i invite you to trie it
